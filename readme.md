# List Virtualization

<em>
Display a huge list of entries but only render the entries that are visible.

I have a large list of several thousands of entries that I want to show to the user.

I want to dispaly the entire list without pagination. But rendering all thousands of entries is performance-wise unpractical.

Instead of rendering all entries at once, the entries should be rendered only when they become visible as the user scrolls up and down the list. This technique is called "virtualization".

# Overlay

<em>Display a view in a large modefull popup.

What react context menu libraries are there?
</em>

- [react-contextmenu](https://github.com/vkbansal/react-contextmenu)







# Sticky

<em>
Make sure that an element is always visible.

The W3C added a specification for `position: sticky` which is great but not implemented in all browsers yet.

The library doesn't need to be a polyfill that complies 100% to the spec.

I just want to make sure that an element is always visible. And I don't want to use `position: fixed` because the element should scroll with the rest of the content and "detach" itself when needs be. Basically the element should switch between "position: static" and "position: fixed". See the W3C `position: sticky` for more information.

Such feature is often used for section headers; For small mobile screens you sometimes get "lost" scrolling within the content of a section and with lost I mean that you don't know in what section you are currently browsing. Sticky makes sure that the current section header is always shown.

Are there libraries to achieve stickyness for a React app?
</em>

 - [react-sticky-node](https://github.com/visortelle/react-sticky-node) - Sticky react component.









# Scroll Up Header

<em>
Hide the header when scrolling down and show it again when scrolling up.

To save vertical space, many mobile apps implement a header that disapears when scrolling down. The user scrolls up to access the header again.
Chrome for mobile does that for example.

Are there such libraries for React?
</em>

 - [react-headroom](https://github.com/KyleAMathews/react-headroom) - Hide your header until you need it.
